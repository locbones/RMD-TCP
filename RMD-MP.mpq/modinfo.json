News 2 Title: "Questing System!"
News 2 Message: "We understand that with the scale of this mod and it's expansion-like experience, it can be a little overwhelming for some players trying to learn the ropes. For this reason, a new softcoded questing system has been added that will both teach you the mod in an organic way, while rewarding you for progression through the mod. Expect this feature to evolve over time, but you can view the current details of it in our Mod Info menu (Quest Charm tab)"
