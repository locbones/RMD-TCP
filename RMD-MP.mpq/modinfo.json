News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.8Z)"
News 1 Message: "This is another fairly large update that should add a lot of fixes and core improvements to the mod. Such as the addition of a more thematic melee splash system, many skill improvements/changes, new item additions, and our usual round of bug fixes to even things out. Expect continued refinement over the drop tables and rates over the coming patches. I hope you guys have fun with the new upgrades, enjoy!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLAN - A D2RLaunch Clone!"
News 2 Message: "With the release of our TCP-enabled mod and client files; we wanted to start working on bringing things up to the level of our SP brethren. D2RLAN will be solely used for TCP-enabled modding, while D2RLaunch will remain for single-player modding. It will obviously look and function almost identically; albeit with some new or changed options. Please be understanding as kinks are worked out and improvements are made; enjoy!"
