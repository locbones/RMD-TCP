News 2 Title: "D2RLAN 1.2.7+"
News 2 Message: "D2RLAN has continued to evolve and push the boundaries of what's possible, while making it as easy-to-use and control as possible. Update 1.2.7 continues that trend; expanding the save file limit, implementing a stash paging system, and allowing socket counts to be displayed with items.
