News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.9D)"
News 1 Message: "While it may have been a bit since the last update due to RL interference, it was worth the wait! Several new large features have been 're-added' to the mod, such as Sunder Mechanic, Terror Zones and Soul Summons. These systems even came with some new upgrades, and will expand in time. As usual, we havn't forgotten our sprinkling of bug fixes either. Enjoy this large update and the future of D2R!"
News 2 Title: "D2RHUD 1.1.2+"
News 2 Message: "The Sunder Mechanic and Terror Zones are now available via D2RHUD 1.1.2+. This will enable re-created features that mimic the official implementation, but with some slight upgrades and more planned improvements in the future. Please visit our discord for more details about how the systems work and info you might need as a mod author."
