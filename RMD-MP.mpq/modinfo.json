News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.9GE)"
News 1 Message: "Another big update coming your way! This update reworks many Necro Summons, adds some new uniques, a new forsaken pact, and improves various quest drop rewards. We've also made some more adjustments to XP Scaling for early and late-game to improve the overall flow. As always, the usual round of bug fixes and small improvements also made the cut. We hope you enjoy this large update and have fun with the new changes!"
