News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.9AK)"
News 1 Message: "This update fixes many user-reported bugs, while enabling the Stash Pages to their 'fullest stable extent' for our community of players. While it may not be as many pages as you wished for, it's where we feel confident of it's impact and limits. As for the mod itself, lots of little fix-ups and improvements to round out the experience. Thanks as always for your support and patience!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLAN 1.2.7+"
News 2 Message: "D2RLAN has continued to evolve and push the boundaries of what's possible, while making it as easy-to-use and control as possible. Update 1.2.7 continues that trend; expanding the save file limit, implementing a stash paging system, and allowing socket counts to be displayed with items. These features are made available for all mods, so I hope you can enjoy them fully!"
