News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.9GAI)"
News 1 Message: "With the big update, comes some bug fixes also. This will fix a lot of small (and some more important) issues that players have reported since the giga update dropped. Unfortunately, if you have items with incorrect/missing names or images, these cannot be fixes, and you musty acquire new versions of the item. Sorry for the inconvenience!"
