News 1 Message: "This update is a bit smaller than most; a lot of us have been busy with holiday prep and such. That said, you can expect a few bug fixes and some christmas flavor added to the mix, until our next major update. Thanks for your patience and enjoy the holidays!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLAN - A D2RLaunch Clone!"
News 2 Message: "With the release of our TCP-enabled mod and client files; we wanted to start working on bringing things up to the level of our SP brethren. D2RLAN will be solely used for TCP-enabled modding, while D2RLaunch will remain for single-player modding. It will obviously look and function almost identically; albeit with some new or changed options. Please be understanding as kinks are worked out and improvements are made; enjoy!"
